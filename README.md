# IFPruning-Implementation

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the paper "Instruction-Following Pruning for Large Language Models".

This code lets you use the model from the paper for inference. You can run your own data through the model to get results similar to the ones described in the paper. The original dataset isn't open source, so this repo doesn't include any training code. We're hoping to add training support in the future.
